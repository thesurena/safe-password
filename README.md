# safe-password
The first mini project after learning Python
This is my first project while learning Python, and at each stage of learning Python, I create a mini project and share it on my GitHub.
To create a random password, copy the codes and compile them on the [Programmize](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) site
